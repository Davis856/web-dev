                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <img src="images/profile.jpg">
                <p>My name is David-Constantin Dobrițoiu and I am studying Computer Science at Babes-Bolyai University. I am currently in the second year of study and I am still learning.</p>
                <p>Among my other passions, one would say that I have a penchant for creating games as well as playing them, for web developing, software engineering and constant learning.
                    I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly.
                    I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.</p>
                <p>I am a student focused on learning new technologies, who's willing to apply them in a company willing to have an intelligent person, problem-solver with great soft skills, who has the ability of finding quick solutions to any problem and is able to place the matter in their own hands.</p>
                <p>I am also interested in Cybersecurity, although I do not have any clue about it, yet.</p>

                    <p class="skill_quote">
                        Currently, I have passed Python and Object-Oriented Programming LinkedIn skill quiz, having a badge in both. In terms of language, I possess a C2 Cambridge English Certificate, and I know a little bit of French. I am planning to learn more about development, and more about Cybersecurity in the future. This part will be updated according to my progress, so take a look at it sometime. </p>
